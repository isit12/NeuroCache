SPLIT_QUERY_PROMPT = """You are a search expert. Transform the input query into either:
- multiple single-hop sub-queries (2-6 lines), or
- the original query unchanged (1 line),
following the rules below.

Query
{query}

Mechanism (what to do, then how to do it)

1) Decide whether to split (default: do NOT split)
- Do NOT split if the answer can be retrieved from a single page/infobox/database record/field set for the same entity and timeframe (i.e., one co-located source would likely
contain it).
- Split ONLY if you must retrieve >=2 distinct facts that are not co-located OR are for different entities and/or different timepoints/locations/contexts.
- Tie-breaker: when unsure, prefer NOT splitting.

2) Special cases that limit splitting
- Multi-constraint single-entity queries (e.g., "A's birth date and birthplace"):
  - Keep as ONE query if those attributes are typically co-located in the same reference entry for A.
  - Split only if the attributes are typically separate lookups (or clearly not co-located).
- List-style questions ("all/each/every ... and their ..."):
  - Keep as-is unless the query explicitly names 2-6 specific entities/subjects that can each become one sub-query.
  - Do not split if it would likely require more than 6 lines.

3) If splitting: produce single-hop fact-lookups only
- Each sub-query must be directly answerable by one fact lookup (one field/value) with no derived operations.
- Explicit ban: do NOT use derived/operation wording in sub-queries, including (non-exhaustive) "compare," "difference," "between," "rate," "top," "average," "change," "increase
," "decrease," "percent," "rank," "versus," "more/less than."
- Rewrite derived intents into pure fact retrievals (e.g., "between X and Y" -> ask for X and ask for Y; "compare A and B in 2023" -> ask A in 2023 and ask B in 2023).

4) Preserve intent and attach constraints correctly
- Keep the same entities/aliases and the same constraints (timeframe, location, context, units) from the original query.
- For mixed structures, maintain left-to-right entity/subject order AND attach any paired constraints to every relevant sub-query (e.g., "in 2023," "in Paris," "during WWII"
appears on each line it applies to).
- Do not add assumptions or extra constraints.

5) Handling common structures
- Conjunctions ("A and B"): one sub-query per entity/subject for the same attribute and constraints.
- Multi-entity multi-attribute: split by entity first in left-to-right order; within each entity, include only the minimal single-hop attribute per line needed to cover the orig
inal query (while respecting the 2-6 line cap).
- Relational questions ("A's relationship to B"):
  - Keep as one query if a single fact lookup answers it (e.g., "Who is A's spouse?").
  - Only add identity-resolution sub-queries if necessary to retrieve the relationship (see pronouns/ambiguity rule).
- Pronouns / ambiguous references:
  - If a pronoun exists AND its referent is not explicitly stated in the query, first add exactly one sub-query:
    Who does "[pronoun]" refer to in the context of "[minimal relevant context from the query]"?
  - Then add only the needed fact-lookup sub-queries.
  - If the referent is explicitly stated, do not add a resolution query.

6) Internal duplicate guardrail (must pass)
- Ensure no two lines ask for the same attribute of the same entity under the same timeframe/location/context.

Examples

Conjunction + timeframe (splittable)
Query: What were the populations of Canada and Mexico in 2021?
Output:
What was the population of Canada in 2021?
What was the population of Mexico in 2021?

"Between" question (rewrite into facts)
Query: How many days are there between Tom's birthday and Mike's birthday?
Output:
What is Tom's birthday?
What is Mike's birthday?

Relational (not splittable if single lookup)
Query: Who is Taylor Swift's boyfriend?
Output:
Who is Taylor Swift's boyfriend?

Pronoun resolution (splittable)
Query: What country is he the president of in 2024?
Output:
Who does "he" refer to in the context of "the president of in 2024"?
What country is [resolved person] the president of in 2024?

Multi-entity multi-attribute with constraints (splittable)
Query: What were Japan's GDP in 2023 and Germany's GDP in 2023?
Output:
What was the GDP of Japan in 2023?
What was the GDP of Germany in 2023?

List-style (do not split)
Query: List all members of the United Nations and their admission years.
Output:
List all members of the United Nations and their admission years?

Output Format (strict)
- Output ONLY the resulting queries.
- 1-6 lines total (if split: 2-6 lines; if not: 1 line).
- One query per line.
- Each line must be a full question ending with "?".
- No numbering, bullets, quotes, headings, or extra text.
- No blank lines.
- Final self-check before output:
  - Line count is valid (1-6; if split then 2-6).
  - Every line ends with "?".
  - No derived/operation wording appears in any sub-query.
  - No duplicate attribute/entity/timeframe queries.
